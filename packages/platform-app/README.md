# Open Targets Platform

See [webapp](https://github.com/opentargets/webapp) for the current production code. See [platform-app](https://github.com/opentargets/platform-app) for the current React rewrite code.

## Usage

This React app was bootstrapped using `create-react-app`. See the `create-react-app` documentation for more details, but the main commands needed are `yarn start` (development mode, watches for file changes) and `yarn build` (build for production, runs once and exits).
